# EEE4022F-Final-Year-Project
This project analyzes how hybrid HVDC (LCCâ€“VSC) and grid-scale BESS affect the transient stability of multimachine power systems. Using a test system (e.g., IEEE 9-bus), the study simulates faults to assess how these technologies improve dynamic performance and prevent cascading failures.

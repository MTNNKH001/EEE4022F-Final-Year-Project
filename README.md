# EEE4022F-Final-Year-Project  
**Transient Stability of Multi-Machine Power Systems with Hybrid HVDC Transmission Lines and Grid-Scale BESS**

## üìò Overview  
This project investigates how **hybrid HVDC systems**‚Äîcombining Line Commutated Converter (LCC) and Voltage Source Converter (VSC) technologies‚Äîand **grid-scale Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)** affect the **transient stability** of multimachine power systems.  
Using the IEEE 9-bus test system modeled in **DIgSILENT PowerFactory**, several fault and disturbance cases were simulated to evaluate how coordinated converter‚Äìstorage control improves grid resilience and prevents cascading failures.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Develop a detailed **IEEE 9-bus multimachine system** integrated with hybrid HVDC and BESS.  
- Implement **control structures** for HVDC converters and BESS to manage active and reactive power exchange.  
- Evaluate the impact on **Critical Clearing Time (CCT)**, **rotor-angle synchronism**, **voltage recovery**, and **frequency support**.  
- Compare results between conventional AC systems and those enhanced with **hybrid HVDC‚ÄìBESS coordination**.
